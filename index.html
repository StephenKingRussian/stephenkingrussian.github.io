    <p><strong>Welcome to the Kingland!</strong></p>

      literary translator, and English teacher. His translation projects include works by Pulitzer Prize–winning author Donna Tartt.
      Stephen King Behind the Iron Curtain is his latest nonfiction book, blending literary history, Cold War and contemporary politics,
      deep knowledge of Russian publishing, and personal passion.</p>
