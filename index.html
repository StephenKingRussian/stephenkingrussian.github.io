        <h2>Stephen King Behind the Iron Curtain</h2>
        <p>Stephen King has terrified and thrilled readers around the world, but few know what happened when his books crossed the Iron Curtain.</p>
        <p>In the Soviet Union, King’s novels were officially published but often mistranslated, censored, or edited to fit the prevailing ideology. And yet, his stories found a wide and devoted readership. Critics debated whether he was a dangerous Western influence or a moral storyteller disguised as a horror writer. His books became both a cultural curiosity and a literary force — sometimes feared, sometimes embraced.</p>
        <p>This book uncovers:<br />
        <ul>
          <li>A Cold War spy scandal involving Stephen King, the FBI, and the KGB</li>
          <li>The tragic shipwreck of the Admiral Nakhimov, whose captain was reading Firestarter when the ship sank</li>
          <li>Why Boris Yeltsin was gifted The Dead Zone before becoming president</li>
          <li>How King’s fiction became part of Russia’s cultural DNA — without the author even knowing</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Spanning four decades of political upheaval, literary obsession, and cultural transformation, Stephen King Behind the Iron Curtain is a captivating exploration of how one American writer’s imagination left a lasting mark on a world behind walls.</p>
        <p>Perfect for fans of Stephen King, Cold War and contemporary history, censorship, and the strange afterlives of literature across borders.</p>
        <p>The book will be soon available worldwide on Amazon!</p>

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
